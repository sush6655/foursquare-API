## INTRODUCTION
-  PROBLEM: The main aim of the project is to solve the problem of an Indian business man trying to find a place to open an Indian restaurant in the city of Fairfax. In this the major problem is that if there are other Indian restaurants stationed in Fairfax city it will be difficult for the business to grow eventually as people most of the time prefer the eat at a know place rather than trying the new cuisine. And, if the business is located near to many Indian restaurants the number of customers arriving the restaurant gradually decreases. Since many people living in the united states are from various culture and background It is also wise to choose location near more populated area with people having the crave for the Indian cuisine. In the proper location there must be various other factors that must be considered.

-  SOLUTION: In this the solution can be obtained using the map locator or an application which is mainly used by the top companies like the google, snapchat, Instagram. The Foursquare API is a platform which has the information of the various restaurants, business, gas stations and information of many more places to explore are available at one place. Let us consider the problem of the business man to open an Indian restaurant in the city of Fairfax from the place of the center of city. Consider through the foursquare API developer tool we can obtain the near by restaurants available near to the center of the city. Thus, solving half of the problem know how many other restaurants are available. In the further problem. The location can be obtained through the maps. The folium maps are using to locate the near by restaurants and help us in obtaining the location to open a new one with in a respective radius. The data used in this project is from the foursquare API where the data of the other restaurants is depicted through a data frame. Though this the map is constructed with the markers and hence an idea of the location can be drawn looking at the coordinates according with the distance from the other dealers.
